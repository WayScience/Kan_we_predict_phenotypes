    "This dataset contains supplementary files from the mitocheck_data repository, focusing on extracted and normalized single-cell features that were too large to upload to GitHub [repo](https://github.com/WayScience/mitocheck_data). \n",

    "The data includes nuclei features from various cell subsets:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Negative Control**: Features from cells transfected with scrambled siRNA.\n",
    "- **Positive Control**: Features from cells transfected with siRNA targeting mitosis-related genes.\n",
    "- **Training Data**: Features from cells manually labeled with phenotypic classes by the MitoCheck Consortium.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the dataset includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **IDR Stream Extracted Features**: Single-cell features extracted using CellProfiler and DeepProfiler.\n",
    "- **Normalized Data**: Features normalized using a StandardScaler derived from negative control data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data relates to the MitoCheck Consortium's original screen, hosted on the Image Data Resource (IDR) under accession [idr0013](https://idr.openmicroscopy.org/webclient/?show=screen-1101) (screenA)."
